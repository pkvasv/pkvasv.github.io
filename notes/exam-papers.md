# Qualifying Exam Papers


## Accessible

- Mixture Models, Robustness, and Sum of Squares Proofs. Samuel B. Hopkins, Jerry Li. STOC 2018.
  - 1-dimensional Gaussian mixture models: Currently most of the way done; just need to verify some technical details.
  - Higher dimensional setting
  - Robust moment estimation
- Noisy Tensor Completion via the Sum-of-Squares Hierarchy. Boaz Barak and Ankur Moitra. COLT 2016.



## Not so accessible, but important

- High-dimensional estimation via sum-of-squares proofs.
Prasad Raghavendra, Tselil Schramm, David Steurer. ICM 2018.
  - Matrix completion: currently stuck here. Don't understand where the dual certificate comes from, why we need, and what it is. See [blog post](https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~gcl22/blog/statistics/probability/matrix/completion/2018/07/08/matrix-completion.html) and Moitra book chapter.
  - Tensor completion
  - Tensor decomposition
