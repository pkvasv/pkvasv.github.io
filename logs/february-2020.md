# February 2020

> A message that I want to burn into my head: at any given point on time, don't work on the ``optimal thing''. Work on whatever you can make a lot of progress on that day. Think of Chandragupta Maurya conquering: start picking off the edges, then work your way in. Make progress wherever you can.

### Braindump

- Wainwright book: I think I have a decent understanding of sparse linear models and PCA, but I would like to consolidate my notes and square things in my head. I was in the middle of the chapters on decomposability + restricted strong convexity and matrix estimation. I can't quite wrap my head around all this machinery; I need to slow down and digest Chapter 9 first. I have also been skipping over much of the probabilistic calculations, eventually I would like to catch up on these.

- Sam's clustering notes: I want to consolidate my notes and type up some SoS stuff for Natesh.

- Identifiability survey: I want to understand matrix completion first, then I am pretty confident I can crack everything in this survey. I think Moitra's book has a good exposition; I want to understand basically everything in there. Also, I understand identifiability when written in the language of the survey, but am having trouble recognizing it when other people write (like in Wainwright's book).

- Permutation-based models: I want to understand the stat-comp gap here, so that I can explain to others.

- Wasserstein based estimators and SoS: I want to get an understanding of what the open problems are/what we hope to gain from applying SoS. Take a look into Pierre Jacob's paper, Jacob's robustness stuff via SoS (notes for background, and paper for open problem). Then, how does this connect to Nhat Ho's work and more general mixture models?

- Understand Moitra-Mossel-Sandon paper at a deeper level.

- Read about sparse covariance thresholding from Yash Deshpande.

- Revisit Chandrasekharan papers and consolidate my understanding of what they do. Try to build a mental list of problems.

- Get back into IBC project.

- Identify project for 6.881. Mainly, I am interested in sampling, sampling from multimodal distributions (see Pillai papers and Risteski papers and Rong Ge papers).

## 2/10/20

- See Martin Wainwright and Ashwin Pananjady papers on permutation based inference. Lots of stat-comp gaps, lot of algorithmic opportunities here. These problems are interesting because they have permutation based structure, which we haven't used SoS for before? Also, related to IBC project.
