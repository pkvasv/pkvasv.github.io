## 11/28/19 - 11/30/19

Took a break.

## 11/27/19

- \[2:00\]: Read about sparse linear models in Wainwright book. Had some good insights that can't be found elsewhere.
- \[0:30\]: Skimmed Harvard STAT 211 lecture notes.

## 11/26/19

- \[1:30\]: Finished homework.

## 11/25/19

- \[6:00\]: Convex geometry homework. Less unpleasant but not pleasant. Talked on Skype with classmate.

## 11/24/19

- \[6:45\]: Probability homework. Not a pleasant experience.

## 11/23/19

- \[1:07\]: Teaching responsibilities.

## 11/22/19

- \[2:15\]: Prepared for meeting. Read more about Gaussian sequence model and least squares estimator. Started reading about minimax lower bounds. Could have been more focused.
- \[1:22\]: Meeting. Have some concrete tasks for next time. In future, whenever stating a theorem, __always__ give examples to clarify, illustrate, and motivate.
- \[2:10\]: Teaching responsibilities and administrative work.

Flew back to Baltimore for Thanksgiving break.


## 11/21/19

- \[0:10\]: Administrative work.
- \[1:30\]: Slowed down and reviewed known results about Gaussian sequence model and least squares estimator.
- \[1:45\]: Continued reading about least squares estimator and Gaussian complexity; gained some new intuitions.
- \[0:10\]: Wrote down some final questions.

Stopped way earlier today. Burnout? Today, purposely slowed down to reduce stress. In future, want to keep stress low. Mindset: "Invesigate".

## 11/20/19

- \[2:00\]: Read about linear regression in notes of Jianqing Fan and notes of Philippe Rigollet.
- \[0:15\]: Administrative work.
- \[0:10\]: Administrative work.
- \[1:45\]: Met to discuss linear regression. Good opportunity to learn more.
- \[0:30\]: Tried to read about lattices.
- \[0:50\]: Continued with Pollard book.

Woke up early, showed up on time. Made a huge difference. Able to go back early again. After meeting, wasn't so effective, had lots of extra slack time.

## 11/19/19

- \[1:05\]: Continued to think about various conjectures and assumptions to base hardness on. Got a bit distracted and lost.
- \[1:18\]: Continued to think about evidence for hardness. Again got stuck and wasn't focused, but came up with more concrete plan towards end. Tomorrow needs to be better. Better to be slow and methodical, without getting lost and always staying on track.
- \[1:15\]: Starting readingg heavy tailed covariance estimation and regression paper. Found some good resources on linear regression.
- \[0:20\]: Planning. Looks like won't be able to implement experiment until after Thanksgiving break; just too many fires to fight.
- \[0:20\]: Read about lattices from Regev lecture notes.
- \[0:20\]: Continued with Pollard book. Wasn't very effective today.


Didn't wake up early. Realized that waking up early is essential to success of experiment. Left 30 minutes early today to prepare to come in early tomorrow.

## 11/18/19

- \[1:05\]: Thought about cryptographic method for showing hardness of learning and how to adapt to our setting. Need to learn in more detail and study more problems to reduce from.
- \[1:10\]: Attended reading group on robust statistics. Mostly review, but had a few small insights.
- \[1:00\]: Went to talk at MIT by Tselil. Understood most of it, except for a few technical details. Very interesting, wrote down a few open problems.
- \[0:30\]: Started on first chapter of Goldwasser-Micciancio book.
- \[0:30\]: Continued with Pollard book.

Woke up late. First day of experiment was a fail. Need to think about how reading groups, talks, and other events get incorporated into the schedule.

## 11/17/19

- \[0:40\]: Thought about Stein's paradox; might actually be connected to suboptimality of empirical mean for heavy tailed mean estimation.
- \[0:30\]: Planning. In the future, hope to follow [J. Michael Steele's advice](): 3+2 everyday. Just need to focus on executing this on two ongoing projects consistently. Be an expert on these two things, and then just be well-rounded otherwise. Also, drive fast on well-paved roads to the frontier; when there is no road left, then get out machete and hack through the jungle. What if Mon-Fri dedicated purely to 3+2, and then do everything else on weekends? Seems like it might actually be doable...will experiment. How do seminars fit into this schedule?
- \[1:36\]: Watched some videos from [past workshop at Simons Institute](https://simons.berkeley.edu/data-science-2018-2), didn't understand a lot but definitely want to revisit min-max formulation of robustness, robust optimization, and Huber's classic work on robust statistics.
- \[1:03\]: Continued with Pollard book. Almost done reading Chapter 2. Made good progress; want to kill it in one month.

From tomorrow on, list the schedule items in the correct order.

## 11/16/19

- \[2:45\]: Teaching responsibilities.
- \[1:10\]: Watched [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_9sbSJz3-w) of talk by Paul Beame on proof complexity. Very interesting, sort of understand another perspective on SoS now and where it comes from. Definitely want to continue to think about these ideas.
- \[3:10\]: Continued thinking about LWE and then looked at hardness of learning. Watched [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeIAwz4W3gA) of talk by Daniely on using average case assumptions to prove hardness of improper learning.
- \[0:20\]: Cotninued with Pollard book.

## 11/15/19

- \[1:07\]: Continued with Pollard book. Just not able to crack it open.
- \[2:05\]: Tried to read about pseudorandomness and k-wise independence; got a bit confused but hopefully articulated why.
- \[1:55\]: Started reading about LWE from Vinod Vaikuntanathan notes. Then started watching easier to understand [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp-IiVpgDlc); entire winter school on lattice based cryptography.

## 11/14/19

- \[1:10\]: Finished writing up summary of project and tasks for myself.
- \[0:45\]: Attended CS colloquium. Maybe in 30 years, these planted signal problems will have real world impact.
- \[1:47\]: Looked into Gamarnik-Zadik papers on sparse linear regression. Started reading connection to SVP; will return later. Read part of paper on compressed sensing with generative priors; had some good ideas and feeling more confident that something interesting is doable along our lines. Need to read the proofs, but should be simple.
- \[0:25\]: Continued with Pollard book.

## 11/13/19

- \[3:23\]: Teaching responsibilities.
- \[2:00\]: Summarized status of instance based complexity project.

Not following along with probability class all that closely...

Single most important thing to improving effectiveness is physical and mental health.

## 11/12/19

- \[0:20\]: Teaching responsibilities.
- \[0:45\]: Continued with Pollard's book.
- \[1:05\]: Finished watching Wainwright tutorial. Recently, overall agenda has become hazy, so started outlining different directions, questions, papers, tasks.
- \[3:09\]: Teaching responsibilities.

## 11/11/19

- \[2:20\]: Found some very interesting papers on arXiv with potential connections to instance based complexity. Watched most of Wainwright [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NobSAUIZOtU). Found an interesting paper on generative priors for spiked matrix models.
- \[1:05\]: Attended statistics colloquium talk by Pierre Jacob. Didn't follow much, but the following would cover most of the background: MCMC, Bayesian inference, unbiasedness, bias-variance tradeoff, priors and posteriors, MLE.
- \[0:23\]: Teaching responsibilities.
- \[0:10\]: Administrative work.
- \[2:00\]: TGINF. Learned something this time.

## 11/10/19

- \[1:27\]: Finished chapter 2.3 in Pollard book.
- \[0:20\]: Teaching responsibilities.
- \[1:40\]: Talked with collaborator; had some good ideas and motivations.
- \[0:15\]: Skimmed video of talk by Adel Javanmard on framework for high-dimensional regression; revisit later.
- \[0:55\]: Continued to think about local complexity in  constrained Gaussian sequence model. Revisited Berthet and Rigollet sparse PCA paper.

Got off to a late start today.

## 11/9/19

- \[0:43\]: Watched most of [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qph2TEWU7Og) of talk on logistic regression in high-dimensional. Was aware of this before, but now realized relevance to robust statistics. AMP stuff showed up again. Didn't understand much of basic statistics background. Why look at MLE vs. posterior in various settings? Which one is better? Which one is more robust? Potentially related to what came up in Yudong Chen talk. Context of M-estimation?
- \[1:19\]: Have some intuition for why local Gaussian width related to lower bounding estimation error of LSE. Made some progress on Chatterjee paper. Looked around in statistics literature to find out what is known about high-dimensional confidence sets and if there is connection to our work.
- \[1:46\]: Teaching responsibilities.

Lost focus towards end of day. Got surpisingly little done.

## 11/8/19

- \[0:40\]: Teaching responsibilities and administrative work.
- \[1:00\]: Attended talk at MIT by Yudong Chen. Quite interesting and was able to follow most of it. Still slightly shaky on primal-dual analysis. Will look into paper details.
- \[2:00\]: Started reading Wei, Fang, Wainwright. Had some good high-level ideas. Returned to Chatterjee paper to understand motivation for local Gaussian width; sort of figured it out, but have no idea how to come up with it in first place. Need to move towards understanding technical details more thoroughly and posing specific technical questions.

Flew back to Boston in morning. Also, need to talk to Pragya Sur in future.

## 11/7/19

- \[1:56\]: Completed probability homework.
- \[2:05\]: Finished watching Michael Jordan video lecture. Watched video of talk by Ben Recht on convex geometry of linear-inverse problems. Next step to read these papers in more detail. Lots of open TCS type questions.
- \[0:40\]: Continued on chapter 2.2 of Pollard's book; things starting to click.

## 11/6/19

- \[0:35\]: Did part of chapter 2.2 of Pollard's book.
- \[4:07\]: Finished up Vershynin survey. Found other relevant papers. Didn't quite understand local Gaussian width. Started watching Michael Jordan talk video. As usual, brilliant.
- \[0:10\]: Administrative work.

An interesting observation, need to test this more carefully: took break on weekend, and was able to get several effective days in a row. Only after several effective, focused days did good ideas start forming. Should do some controlled trials; maybe taking one day off per week pays for itself (+ more).

## 11/5/19

- \[3:44\]: Morning session on instance based complexity was absolutely horrible. Watched videos of talks by Yuting Wei and Joel Tropp, jumped around between too many papers, didn't get anything done. Better focus in the afternoon. Read through about half of Vershynin tutorial, need to
- \[0:50\]: Teaching responsibilities.
- \[0:46\]: Read chapter 2.1 of Pollard's book.

## 11/4/19

- \[0:10\]: Email and administrative work.
- \[3:56\]: Teaching responsibilities.
- \[2:00\]: Read papers by Wainwright and others. Finally found framework to build and language to use. Now that first blood is in the water, hunt has begun. Just need to pursue doggedly - where there is smoke, there is fire.

## 11/3/19

- \[0:21\]: Teaching responsibilities. Will be slightly heavier this week, then should come back to normal.
- \[1:15\]: Finished most of Pollard chapter 1. Still a bit shaky on fair price interpretation; do some exercises to understand well.
- \[1:30\]: Wrote up thoughts on instance-based complexity, identified some concrete directions.
- \[1:30\]: Teaching responsibilities.

When learning, try to identify quickly the unknowns, weaknesses, gaps in knowledge. Then, jump directly on problems that address them. Need to build a habit of asking the right questions (like the above) and having the right mentality when reading. Remember, goal is to always keep incrementally learning and increasing knowledge. Otherwise, reading without purpose is useless. Maybe construct a short list on a chit to remind and keep close while reading?

## 11/2/19

- \[0:30\]: Started thorough pass through Pollard book, from Chapter 1.

Took break most of day.

## 11/1/19

- \[0:50\]: Various small tasks - teaching responsibilities, email, printing, scheduling, paying rent.
- \[1:30\]: Prepared for bandits reading group.
- \[2:15\]: Bandit reading group. Seems like martingale methods can give much simpler and cleaner analyses of bandit algorithms. This is why it is so important to master tools and recognize when to apply them. Also discussed what to talk about in future meetings - same theme of average case (Bayesian regret) vs. worst case (minimax regret) popping up. Have a policy that is competitive w.r.t. fixed policy class (just like inductive bias in formulation of learning problem)? Looked over some recent papers on RL and control; seems like an interesting literature to understand.


Flight back to Baltimore late tonight. Got a bit of work done in section.
