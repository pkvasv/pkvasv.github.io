write up thoughts on LDLR survey, try to produce something concrete and actually do research
extract remains of miolane survey
Multiple spikes paper + execute LDLR method
think about mean estimation (covariance, tensor norm, steinhardt thesis, QUE)
Review SoS
Write up notes up to where you got stuck on Bandeira-Kunisky paper
Try to find Montanari paper where he analyzes Gibbs distribution associated with SOS(2)


- read miolane notes once and for all and type it up
- type up clearly everything of use from el alaoui thesis one last time
- get main ideas behind kikuchi hierarchy paper for thursday meeting
- review talagrand book and type up. then return to multiple spike paper
- read ldlr notes carefully and type up notes. go through most of calculations and make sure to understand how to execute it yourself.
- review SoS thoroughly and also see connection to spectral algorithms.


## 9/30/19

- \[2:20\]: Worked on covariance estimation, couldn't recover conjecture from key lemma. Read into papers of Lugosi, Mendelson, Zhivotovskiy. Need to read Vershynin functional analysis notes.
- \[1:00\]: Finished watching video of lecture on interpolation and double descent curve.
- \[1:00\]: Second pass through Rademacher complexity part of Raginsky lecture notes. Hopefully last pass.
- \[0:15\]: Administrative work.

## 9/29/19

- \[2:45\]: Worked on covariance estimation conjecture. Good opportunity to learn more about empirical process theory. Techniques should be useful in future, lots of future directions.

## 9/28/19

- \[1:15\]: Watched video of lecture by Ben Recht.
- \[0:15\]: Read about model selection.
- \[0:15\]: Watched part of video on interpolation.

Forgot what else. Wasted a lot of time looking up books and resources.

## 9/27/19

- \[1:30\]: Finished writing up homework.
- \[3:15\]: Finished watching videos on generalization theory.

## 9/26/19

- \[4:30\]: Probability homework, toxic (!).


## 9/25/19

- \[3:00\]: Thought about generalized covariance problem, wrote up where stuck. Started reviewing motivation behind conjecture, but got bogged down. In hindsight, many of these things are very simple with the right tools. Next step is to understand MZ18 paper again. Need to try to maintain high level of focus throughout the 3 hours.
- \[2:00\]: Reviewed notes on statistical learning theory.

## 9/24/19

- \[2:35\]: Thought about covariance estimation. Next step is to check conjecture implies our algorithm generalizes and then dig into conjecture.
- \[1:30\]: Watched next video of lecture on generalization.
- \[0:05\]: Found a nice resource on probabilistic programming.
- \[0:50\]: Started reading Bartlett lecture notes on learning theory.

## 9/23/19

- \[1:00\]: Continued reading Steinhardt lecture notes.
- \[1:00\]: Watched assorted "academic" videos.
- \[1:30\]: Watched [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ntl_WNW8yGc) of lecture on generalization.

## 9/22/19

- \[2:00\]: Read Steinhardt lecture notes on robust statistics.

## 9/21/19

- \[2:00\]: Reviewed spectral graph theory, wasn't so effective.

## 9/20/19

- \[6:00\]: Reviewed measure theory and worked on probability homework.

## 9/19/19

- \[1:30\]: Watched some videos on probabilistic programming. Very interesting idea, hope to learn more in future.

## 9/11/19 to 9/18/19

Medical issue, couldn't do anything. Following days will also be slow.

## 9/11/19

- \[1:50\]: Though about heavy-tailed covariance estimation. Fairly confident that everything boils down to our conjecture. Next step is to really focus on just the conjecture.
- \[0:15\]: Thought about applying partial trace method for designing fast algorithms from SoS to our problem; seems promising.
- \[1:30\]: Watched new video on robust statistics, need to read carefully.

## 9/10/19

- \[0:30\]: Various administrative work.
- \[0:37\]: Reviewed own notes on SoS.
- \[0:47\]: Finished with Miolane notes for now. All that remains is to type up notes.
- \[0:45\]: Read about fast spectral algorithms from SoS in Tselil's thesis.
- \[2:30\]: Started thorough pass through LDLR notes.


Given business of this semester, goal is to do average of four hours of research per day. Need to think carefully about allotting these hours to produce outcomes.

## 9/9/19

- \[0:05\]: Review notes on sampling from convex bodies.
- \[0:15\]: Thought about faster robust mean estimation.
- \[2:10\]: Revied Miolane notes and finished writing own notes.
- \[0:47\]: Scheduling (!)

Seems like teaching responsibilities will be heavier than expected, so need to be a bit more focused when it comes to research and make the most of available time.

## 9/6/19

- \[2:08\]: Continued reading Vempala survey. Made decent progress, doing better at not getting stuck on small details.
- \[0:22\]: Thought about multiple spiked tensor model and its relevance.
- \[1:05\]: Tried to read multiple spiked tensor model paper, but got stuck with spin glass notation again.
- \[0:25\]:Planning.
- \[1:00\]: Skimmed over slides on Kikuchi hierarchy. Need to get a better understanding of context, especially on relationship between SoS and spectral algorithms.

Afternoon was quite ineffective. Need to return and systematically understand things so that they don't come back to bite.

## 9/5/19

- \[0:15\]: Administrative stuff and email.
- \[1:30\]: Started reading Lee-Vempala notes, but lots of technical details missing, so switched to older [survey by Vempala](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~vempala/papers/survey.pdf), which should be fairly easy to read.
- \[0:10\]: Skimmed to Mertens-Moore book chapter.
- \[1:05\]: Attended CS colloquium. Need to choose which talks to attend more carefully.
- \[2:10\]: Thought about LDLR and started reading multiple spiked tensor model paper. Had some initial calculations but need to be more forceful despite being tired.

## 9/4/19

- \[2:00\]: Finished Sinclair MCMC notes for now, will return in future. Started chapter on sampling in Lee-Vempala notes.
- \[0:30\]: Administrative stuff and scheduling (!)
- \[2:00\]: Hangouts call with collaborators on mean estimation problem. Next step is to think more carefully about covariance case and decide whether any non-trivial result is possible.
- \[2:00\]: Read [Kunisky-Wein-Bandeira notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11636) on LDLR.


Class lecture schedule is Tu/Th 11-12:30 and Mo/We 10:30-11:45. Will not be recording these, will leave as implicit. Do plan to record time outside of lecture.

## 9/3/19

- \[2:50\]: Read Sinclair MCMC lecture notes. Should be able to finish in another day.
- \[0:10\]: Administrative work.
- \[2:30\]: Continued reading notes by Miolane. Still need to capture technical details, but picture is more clear now.

Went to sleep late and woke up late past two days.

## 9/2/19

- \[1:40\]: Read Sinclair MCMC notes. Common pattern is spending a large fraction of time on small steps in technical calculations. Need think about how to speed up.
- \[0:30\]: Wrote notes up to where got stuck in Bandeira-Kunisky paper. Maybe return later.
- \[1:40\]: Read [notes by Miolane](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04343). Can finally get a complete understanding of this area. See also recent paper by Zdeborova that suggests AMP may not be optimal. After reading this, can start typing up expository note to collect intuitions from various sources in one place. Next steps also include looking more closely into analysis of AMP (especially for non-compressed sensing applications). See [Deshpande's thesis](http://www.mit.edu/~yash/PAPERS/thesis.pdf).
- \[0:10\]: Planning.

Had a (long) TA meeting today. Don't plan on recording that time here in the future.

## 9/1/19

- \[2:50\]: Read Sinclair MCMC notes. Started volume estimation.
- \[1:00\]: Read Chapter 14 in Mertens-Moore book. Brain wasn't working so well. Next time need to keep a pencil in hand.
- \[2:00\]: Started reading Bandeira-Kunisky 2019 preprint, but got stuck.

Wasn't so effective today.
