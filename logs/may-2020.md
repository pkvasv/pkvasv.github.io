Today is a Monday. I realized that after taking the weekend off, I am lacking momentum on Monday morning. Usually, Monday and Tuesday are wasted and I don't warm up until Wednesday (by which point I start winding down again). For the future, let me leave watching videos and other easy/enjoyable things for Monday and Tuesday.
