# October 2019

> Better than a thousand days of diligent work is one day with a great teacher.


## 10/31/19

- \[0:15\]: Skimmed paper on circuit complexity of inference. Definitely need to understand motivations and context well.
- \[2:25\]: Reviewed Gaussian sequence model notes from yesterday and looked at related statistics papers. Finished quick pass through full chapter 2. Will return to capture details later, but want to move on to make sure there is __some__ value. Skimmed chapter 3; need some functional and Fourier analysis background and not sure how relevant is infinite sequence model. Moving to chapters 4 and 5 next.
- \[0:27\]: Administrative work.
- \[1:10\]: Went to talk at MIT by Guy Bresler; wasn't worth spending all day at MIT
- \[0:10\]: Discussed why nonparametric models and neural networks might exhibit similar phenomena.
- \[2:00\]: Wrote up probability homework. Took WAY more time than necessary. Made lots of small mistakes and didn't try to solve it cleanly.

Morning routine got messed up slightly, so was quite ineffective. From now on, better to postpone arXiv to later in the day. Had some good high-level ideas while walking back from MIT.

## 10/30/19

- \[0:15\]: Skimmed Pollard book during class. Should be able to work through most of it quite easily and quickly.
- \[0:45\]: Met with Natesh Pillai. Got some interesting new ideas and know next steps.
- \[1:05\]: Continued reading Steinhardt paper. Will try to understand framework one piece at a time. First step is to understand TV distance case (infinite sample analysis, finite sample analysis, and computational version). Then, look into Wasserstein distance and other distances.
- \[1:00\]: Email and administrative work. Set up new printer, submitted forms, cleaned desk.
- \[1:45\]: Read up to section 2.3 in Johnstone's book. Understanding first few chapters well should pay off. Even basic Gaussian sequence model gives clear explanations for various phenomena. Good way to tune intuition and make good predictions for more complicated setups. Printed out physical copies, want to see if focus improves.
- \[0:58\]: Solved all problems on probability homework, starting to write them up now.


## 10/29/19

- \[0:15\]: Administrative work and email.
- \[2:19\]: Continued reading Steinhardt paper. Productivity went down toward the end. Couldn't sink my teeth very deep. Printed out physical paper copy, want to see if that makes a difference.
- \[1:50\]: ML theory seminar.
- \[1:26\]: Discussed potential connections between differential privacy and robustness. Next step is to look into information theoretic notions of DP and papers of John Duchi.


## 10/28/19

- \[2:10\]: Grading.
- \[0:10\]: Read Pollard book in class. Fair price interpretation of probability makes more intuitive sense.
- \[0:20\]: Planning.
- \[1:10\]: Reading through Steinhardt paper.
- \[1:42\]: TGINF. Got lost at the end, but followed most of the time.

No one showed to section today, so used time to grade.

## 10/27/19

Took a break, but thought about high level strategy.

## 10/26/19

Took a break, but thought about high level strategy.

## 10/25/19

- \[1:55\]: Read about martingales for bandits reading group presentation.
- \[1:30\]: Bandits reading group.
- \[0:30\]: Read part of first chapter of Tsybakov book. More motivation to study functional and fourier analysis.

Waking up early this week, but somehow not gaining much time. Need to make more effective use of time. OH ran over by 20 minutes.

## 10/24/19

- \[3:09\]: Read about martingales for bandits reading group presentation.
- \[1:15\]: Attended CS colloquium by Michael Jordan. Look up the video of this talk; don't ever forget it. Truly a MJ23-esque performance. Highlights the importance of mastering the fundamentals and using the correct tools. This is how research should be done.
- \[1:02\]: Prepared for section tonight. Ran section at night on behalf of someone else.

Went to to sleep late and didn't sleep too well.

## 10/23/19

- \[2:00\]: Studied for probability exam. As usual, didn't study enough or correctly. Got lazy during studying. Exam was an opportunity to learn everything thoroughly, but still don't have a strong grasp.
- \[1:00\]: Preparing for bandits reading group. Initially planned to discuss concentration, but then decided not needed. Essentially wasted time.
- \[1:10\]: Went to lecture for economics and policy people because Esther Duflo was a panelist. Left early and didn't get to hear her speak. Complete waste of time.

Had 5 open hours after coming back from lunch, but completely bungled things.

## 10/22/19

- \[0:20\]: Email and administrative stuff.
- \[1:00\]: Studied for probability exam.
- \[0:20\]: Discussed Bayesian regret. Seems interesting, want to learn more.
- \[2:00\]: Attended ML theory seminar.

## 10/21/19

- \[0:40\]: Studied for probability exam by going through textbook.
- \[1:05\]: Various emails and administrative tasks + planning.
- \[1:05\]: Attended statistics colloquium, lots of good high-level motivations and philosophy.
- \[0:35\]: Met to discuss spectral graph theory homework.
- \[0:15\]: Grading stuff.
- \[1:03\]: TGINF.


## 10/20/19

- \[1:30\]: Finished writing up spectral graph theory homework. Might do one more problem.
- \[0:30\]: Handled regrades.
- \[0:20\]: Planning.
- \[2:43\]: (Unplanned) discussion on stochastic bandits and UCB. Seems like bandits are widely studied, yet proofs of even basic results are not so clean or well motivated. Would be interesting to give unified view of analyses for all these different models. Also, potential connection to robustness: why do adaptive algorithms work (in bandit settings) despite the fact that they derive estimates based on biased and non-iid data?
- \[\]

Woke up late AGAIN.

## 10/19/19

- \[0:15\]: Planning.
- \[0:10\]: Brief grading.
- \[0:10\]: Skimmed papers of Ariel Procaccia. Lots of open questions about doing statistics when strategic agents are involved, seems like there should be connections to robustness. Definitely revisit in future.
- \[1:30\]: Finished watching lecture on Bayesian nonparametrics. Was slightly distracted.
- \[1:20\]: Wrote up about 1.25 problems from spectral graph theory homework.
- \[0:40\]: Started reviewing for probability exam by doing some practice problems. Didn't seem to hard, but do need to go through Durrett's book.
- \[0:38\]: Read most of Chapter 1 of Pollard's book.
- \[0:20\]: Reviewed status of HDP (for attacking covariance estimation). Starting to develop some basic intuitions that didn't have before.


Woke up quite late, so got off to a slow start. Motivation and focus were lukewarm today. Starting to detect weakness and dip in effectiveness over this past week, possibly due to lack of sleep.

## 10/18/19

- \[1:30\]: Finished and submitted probability homework.
- \[1:00\]: Went to talk by Suvrit Sra at workshop. Didn't understand (the basic) differential geometry, but might be useful to learn to get better understanding of optimal transport and Wasserstein spaces.
- \[1:00\]: Prepared for OH.
- \[0:30\]: Watched [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uuW0xtoKNw) of lecture on Bayesian nonparametrics. Very interesting. Wasn't very effective at all after OH.

## 10/17/19

- \[1:15\]: Attended colloquium talk by Zoubin Gharamani, very interesting but started falling asleep.
- \[1:00\]: Attended talk by advisor at workshop. Was able to follow for the most part.
- \[0:40\]: Continued reading about Riemann-Stieltjes integration. Need to work through some interesting examples.
- \[0:30\]: Worked on probability homework, almost done then need to write up and submit.
- \[0:20\]: Reviewed statistical physics notes.
- \[2:10\]: Discussed statistical physics approach to predicting computation-to-statistical gaps.

## 10/16/19

- \[4:30\]: Attended [CMSA workshop](https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/noncommutative-analysis/). Understood very little from Garg/Oliveira talks (due to insufficient math background) and didn't learn much from Harrow talks. Might be useful to build a basic foundation in quantum information theory just to understand Harrow papers. Also, need background on UGC and SSE. Interesting connection between net-based algorithms and SoS. In conclusion, be careful about going to talks without doing pre-reading.
- \[0:40\]: Worked on probability homework.
- \[0:35\]: Reviewed Riemann-Stieltjes integration. Started reading Pollard's book - next level stuff.
- \[1:20\]: Hangouts call with collaborator, had a lot of new insights and ideas for future research directions.

## 10/15/19

- \[1:35\]: Worked on covariance estimation. Wrote up some calculations.
- \[1:05\]: Finished video from yesterday, wasn't all that helpful.
- \[0:21\]: Finished off midterm exam grading.
- \[1:20\]: Worked on spectral graph theory homework, will writeup 3 minimum problems tomorrow and leave remaining for weekend.
- \[0:50\]: Worked on probability homework.
- \[0:20\]: Started reading lecture notes from Vinod Vaikuntanathan's LWE course.

An observation: homework can be finished **much** faster if completely focused. Do initial exploration phase, then think about problems while walking around, then sit down once and solve exactly instead of doing many low quality solutions. Woke up slightly late today.

## 10/14/19

- \[1:30\]: Preparation for meeting and writing down notes afterward.
- \[1:30\]: Meeting. Have concrete directions to pursue.
- \[2:15\]: Worked on spectral graph theory homework, mostly done but need to write up carefully.
- \[0:15\]: Watched part of [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVFw_qb1ZkY) on lattice based cryptography.
- \[2:00\]: TGINF.


## 10/13/19

- \[1:10\]: Continued working through Vershynin book. Solved two problems, was more focused.
- \[3:18\]: Grading problem sets.
- \[2:10\]: Thought more about instance based complexity. Looked more into probabilistic programming; don't really understand. Look into exchangeability in the future.

## 10/12/19

- \[1:45\]: Continued working through Vershynin book. Again, wasn't so effective, but slightly better than yesterday. Need to kill Chapter 2 tomorrow.
- \[3:20\]: Exam grading.
- \[1:15\]: Thought about spectral graph theory problems, figured out most of them, but a few unresolved remain. Hopefully finish up tomorrow.
- \[0:10\]: Administrative work.
- \[0:25\]: Read [blog post](https://www.offconvex.org/2019/10/03/NTK/) on NTK.


## 10/11/19

- \[2:30\]: Prepared for meeting. Mixture of administrative tasks and reviewing research.
- \[1:00\]: Met with advisor.
- \[0:25\]: Talked about probability homework.
- \[1:15\]: Finished almost all of administrative work (PhD program plan).
- \[1:10\]: Continued working through Vershynin book. Again, wasn't so effective.

## 10/10/19

- \[2:40\]: Wrote up and submitted probability homework.
- \[1:00\]: Attended talk on program synthesis by Ras Bodik. Very interesting.
- \[0:10\]: Email.
- \[0:45\]: Reading into probabilistic programming and automated inference. Had an interesting thought on how to formalize a question; will try to write down tomorrow.
- \[0:40\]: Continued with scalar concentration inequalities in Vershynin book. Slow progress today.

## 10/9/19

- \[1:45\]: Worked on spectral graph theory homework, made some progress.
- \[0:10\]: Email.
- \[1:45\]: Worked on probability homework; made good progress, almost finished it in one shot.
- \[1:35\]: Worked on covariance estimation. Shelved matrix concentration approach for now, will return to after meeting. Looked into empirical process approach. Went through parts of Raginsky lecture notes, it probably makes more sense to just do Vershynin book anyways.
- \[0:30\]: Went back to early chapters of Vershynin. Started to get some intuition of Poisson vs. Gaussian approximations.

Finally woke up early today. Have been noticing small mistakes and lower focus due to reduced sleep past few days.

## 10/8/19

- \[0:55\]: Reviewed expectation and integration, looked at probability homework problems.
- \[0:15\]: Continued reading Chapter 2 of Vershynin book. Try to understand when scalar concentration inequalities should be tight or when to apply each inequality.
- \[2:00\]: Attended talk by Madry on robustness ML.
- \[1:30\]: Worked on covariance estimation. Had some new thoughts, having reviewed matrix Laplace transform method. Should set up meeting soon. Didn't get back to empirical process approach yet.
- \[0:30\]: Reviving instance based complexity project.


## 10/7/19

- \[0:50\]: Reviewed expanders in Spielman book and started working on spectral graph theory book.
- \[1:30\]: Worked on covariance estimation. Did more of matrix concentration calculations. Seemingly simplified things to one matrix concentration inequality, but have no idea what answer to expect or how to proceed. Not sure of connection to conjecture either, but hopefully can meet this week and clarify. Need to look into empirical process approach.
- \[0:30\]: Started reading initial chapters of Tropp's book to learn basic approach to proving matrix concentration.
- \[0:58\]: Gave advice on graduate school admissions.
- \[0:50\]: TGINF. Arrived late, so didn't understand too much.

Went to sleep very late last night. Skipped ToC colloquium. Teaching duties will likely be quite heavy this week.

## 10/6/19

- \[0:10\]: Brief TA work.
- \[2:20\]: Finished reviewing spectral graph theory for now. Wrote notes up to random walks, but not for expanders. Will just start working on homework next time.
- \[2:45\]: Worked on covariance estimation. Started some of the calculations, but essentially gave up upon running into matrix concentration calculations. Need to be more focused and direct next time.
- \[0:35\]: Started going through Vershynin book Chapter 1 carefully.

After not working on research for a few days, completely lost train of thought. Need to make sure to think about it every day, even if only for 20 minutes.

## 10/5/19

- \[4:15\]: Reviewed spectral graph theory. Skipped approximate counting for now, will return in future. All that remains is to read sections on random walks and expanders until fully caught up.

## 10/4/19

- \[3:00\]: Got back up to date for teaching duties.
- \[1:05\]: Reviewed spectral graph theory.

Had OH today and will have regularly from now on; do not plan to report hours here.

- \[4:35\]: Finished probability homework.
- \[0:30\]: Reviewed Chapter 2 of Vershynin book.

## 10/2/19

- \[1:00\]: Reviewed measure and integration, things starting to click. Reinforce with MIT lecture notes and Durrett book.
- \[1:00\]: Continued on covariance estimation. Got rough idea of how to recover reduction of key lemma to conjecture.
- \[0:30\]: Talked with someone about new problem. Might be opportunity to read Ashia Wilson thesis and systematic discretization of continuous process to obtain algorithms.
- \[1:30\]: Worked on probability homework.

Back to campus and classes.

## 10/1/19

- \[0:20\]: Administrative work.
- \[4:00\]: Worked on probability homework.
- \[1:00\]: Continued reading Raginsky lecture notes.

Took break from covariance estimation until collaborator responds.
