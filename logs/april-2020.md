- David Goggins on why we revert back to bad habits: we set the initial bar too high.
- I decided to give up on my first two 20 hour projects. I had invested about 6-7 hours each and it was turning into a grind. I also realized (only after investing those hours) that those topics weren't all that interesting or useful. My original reason for choosing them was that I hoped there would be some problem which can be extracted from its context and solved by TCS methods. However, I realized that in order for this to happen, I actually need to be an expert on something ("have a home base"), which I don't feel am yet. Digging in other areas is very labor intensive and I think it is especially wasteful if the probability that I have the ability to take advantage of an opportunity when one arises is quite low. The most useful thing I can do is increase this probability, then explore other areas.
- Regarding time consuming calculations: For me, following the details and replicating them myself takes up a huge amount of time. On the other hand, I am fairly good at extracting the key ideas and overall proof structure. From now on, I should try to only do calculations which I need to survive (such as SoS calculations or to solve a concrete problem at hand) on a daily basis. As Richard Hamming would say: why kill myself for something I probably won't use? Once I have mastered the fundamental skills I need, I can go apply them wherever related problems show up.
- Having interacted with more professors up close, I realize that most (but not all) have a very narrow expertise and it doesn't bother them too much that they don't understand everything about everything. In academia, I think specialization (to some extent) is necessary to succeed. For example, about a year ago, I used to think probability and statistics are very closely tied (which they are). But, my impression from statisticians is that they actually view probability a separate subject, part of mathematics, and that they only use it a (very useful) tool. They don't obsess over mastering probability - they just develop the tool as needed.
- In light of this, my areas of focus are hardness of approximation and SoS. On a secondary level, statisical physics is of relevance due to its relationship to comp-stat gaps. My goal is to really understand it (as well as relevant tools like probability, Markov chains, geometry of polynomials) for the purpose of better understanding computational complexity from a different perspective. Hyperbolic programming, SoS theory and optimization in general are also worth exploring deeply. I just need to stick to these topics and build a thorough base. This frees me from having to understand too deeply all the other topics I listed. For those, I just watch high level talks, talk with people, read pre-digested papers and pounce at the right moment. Otherwise, I should be lazy about these topics.
- Another misconception that I had was that I can also learn some skills which might be practically relevant as part of my usual studies for research. This is wrong. The best way to learn practical skills is to do practical projects and drop all pretenses. As I discussed before, academia is for being intentionally useless.

- Yesterday, I watched [a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY) on how to learn things in 20 hours. I like this approach because it is a small commitment for a tangible reward. As an experiment, I will implement this method for some topics I want to learn about. The four main principles are:
  1. Deconstruct the skill. Break into small steps.
  2. Learn enough to self-correct and experiment with it.
  3. Remove practice barriers. For example, just pick up 2-4 resources; don't let yourself procrastinate by collecting 20 videos, 20 books, 20 papers, etc... (like I always do).
  4. Devote 20 focused hours.
- I have also been listening to Ido Portal. He has some good ideas but they are elusive.
