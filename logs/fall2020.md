| [El Alaoui-Krzakala 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01593])     | Read + wrote notes. Skipped some technical details, see Talagrand book first. Want to understand role of overlap concentration better. | 08/27/2019 |
| [El Alaoui-Krzakala-Jordan 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09588) | Read + wrote notes for high-level outline. Technical details don't seem so useful. | 08/28/2019 |
| [Barbier-Macris 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02780) | Read main example. Need to revisit after reading simpler cases first. | 08/29/2019 |
