## 8/05/19

- \[0:15\]: Updated logs after a few days.

## 8/04/19

- \[3:00\]: Read survey on BP. Watched talk on computing partition functions by convex programming hierarchies.
- \[0:15\]: Worked on draft.

Past three days were absolutely horrible; couldn't focus at all and didn't get much done. Need to stop optimizing for time and just focus on learning.

Had an idea for thesis subject.

Listened to ideas by [Firas Zahabi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fbCcWyYthQ). Read an [article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/graduate-student-solves-quantum-verification-problem-20181008/). Need to work *smarter* not harder. Work in manner that is sustainable and generates large *volume* over long period of time.

## 8/03/19

- \[3:00\]: Read survey on BP and other related things.
- \[0:15\]: Worked on draft

## 8/02/19

- \[3:00\]: Didn't record this day until 08/05/19, so forgot details.

Woke up 1 hour late. Got delayed slightly by an errand. Had an interesting thought about interpolation method while in shower.

## 8/01/19

- \[1:05\]: Still reading Section 8 of Raginsky notes. Reached up to neural networks, skipped AdaBoost.
- \[1:15\]: Finished empirical process theory notes, except for some calculations in proof of Sudakov-Fernique. Roughly understand the main idea behind interpolation method.
- \[0:50\]: Returned to Talagrand book, skimmed over Section 1.3, understand the high-level approach now. Concluded that it would be best to return to Talagrand book later. In long term future, Mezard-Montanari and Moore-Mertens books might be useful. Next steps are to read Moore's survey on community detection and then return to Section 4 of El Alaoui thesis.
- \[1:50\]: Did one more pass over draft, made some minor edits, fixed some small calculations.


Ironically, encountered all these resources a year ago and now coming back to bite.
