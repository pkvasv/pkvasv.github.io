# August 2019

## 8/07/19

- \[0:20\]: Watched part of a talk on MCMC.
- \[0:40\]: Read up to Section 2.5 in Montanari-Mezard book.
- \[1:25\]: Watched a video of a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYP9ZpJmImw). Hoping to learn more about Barvinok's method for approximating partition functions.
- \[1:30\]: Tried to read about RS formulas for Bayesian inference problems. Got stuck due to lack of background; plan to read [notes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11132.pdf) first.

Woke up very late this morning. Wasn't as effective as the last two days. Tried to follow some video lectures, but got lost quickly. Main difference was that didn't have a single, big, concrete task. In future, will try to have one big task each day and just focus on that.


## 8/06/19

- \[0:35\]: Worked on draft, basically done.
- \[3:52\]: Review notes on Section 3 of Wainwright-Jordan survey. Read Bethe approximation in Section 4 and connection to BP. Read mean-field approximation in Section 5 and interpretation as KL-divergence minimization.
- \[0:25\]: Skimmed a blog post about sampling from multi-modal distributions. Hope to learn more about sampling in the future.

Had an errand this morning and woke up late, so delayed slightly.

## 8/05/19

- \[0:15\]: Updated logs after a few days.
- \[4:46\]: Read Section 3 of Wainwright-Jordan survey and reviewed [exponential families](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/courses/260-spring10/other-readings/chapter8.pdf). Struggled in the beginning due to notation and such, but realized at the end that the ideas are actually quite simple. In future, reading on this topic will become easier and more efficient. As always, first time beginning a new subject is hard. Need to carry momentum forward.

Was much more effective today. Did not take any breaks until all work finished. Did not obsess about working a particular number of hours; just recorded it in a detached manner. Ate a quick lunch and immediately got back to to work. Repeating this day 100 times will produce lots of progress.

## 8/04/19

- \[3:00\]: Read survey on BP. Watched talk on computing partition functions by convex programming hierarchies.
- \[0:15\]: Worked on draft.

Past three days were absolutely horrible; couldn't focus at all and didn't get much done. Need to stop optimizing for time and just focus on learning.

Had an idea for thesis subject.

Listened to ideas by [Firas Zahabi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fbCcWyYthQ). Read an [article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/graduate-student-solves-quantum-verification-problem-20181008/). Need to work *smarter* not harder. Work in manner that is sustainable and generates large *volume* over long period of time.

> Throw a bucket of water on a rock and has no effect. Let a drop of water fall onto a rock everyday and it creates a hole in that rock."

Only need to do things each day:

- Single drop of water
- Make sure the drop falls on the same spot it did yesterday
- Trust that the hole will form

## 8/03/19

- \[3:00\]: Read survey on BP and other related things.
- \[0:15\]: Worked on draft

## 8/02/19

- \[3:00\]: Didn't record this day until 08/05/19, so forgot details.

Woke up 1 hour late. Got delayed slightly by an errand. Had an interesting thought about interpolation method while in shower.

## 8/01/19

- \[1:05\]: Still reading Section 8 of Raginsky notes. Reached up to neural networks, skipped AdaBoost.
- \[1:15\]: Finished empirical process theory notes, except for some calculations in proof of Sudakov-Fernique. Roughly understand the main idea behind interpolation method.
- \[0:50\]: Returned to Talagrand book, skimmed over Section 1.3, understand the high-level approach now. Concluded that it would be best to return to Talagrand book later. In long term future, Mezard-Montanari and Moore-Mertens books might be useful. Next steps are to read Moore's survey on community detection and then return to Section 4 of El Alaoui thesis.
- \[1:50\]: Did one more pass over draft, made some minor edits, fixed some small calculations.


Ironically, encountered all these resources a year ago and now coming back to bite.
