- [1:30]: Skimmed [Lee-Padmanabhan 2019] and [Arora-Kale 2007] to see if solvers can be implemented without explicitly computing $A^T A$. Realized that probably won't work for our application because they use JL. Next step is to look into inverse maintenance approach.
- [0:30]: Read Boaz email and skimmed tensor network stuff. No useful thoughts.
- [0:30]: Setup logging system.

Main accomplishment was watching Djokovic-Federer Wimbledon final.
