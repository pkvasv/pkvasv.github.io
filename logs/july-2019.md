- \[2:10\]: Revisited the dynamic eigenvector approach. Concluded that we need to exploit special properties of update matrix $D$. Next step is see if Lee-Sidford inverse maintenance paper has any relevant ideas.
- \[3:15\]: Planned out next steps and typed up handwritten notes on Banks et al. paper. Need to finish typing up sketch of calculations for two examples and formalize questions and intuitions. Once that is done, can finally begin to move forward.
- \[0:10\]: Looked at notes on canonical SDP relaxation for CSPs from Gupta-O'Donnell lecture notes since the approach might be useful. See also Chapter in O'Donnell book for more background.

- \[1:30\]: Skimmed \[Lee-Padmanabhan 2019\] and \[Arora-Kale 2007\] to see if solvers can be implemented without explicitly computing $A^T A$. Realized that probably won't work for our application because they use JL. Next step is to look into inverse maintenance approach.
- \[0:30\]: Read advisor's email and skimmed tensor network stuff.
- \[0:30\]: Setup logging system.

Main accomplishment was watching Djokovic-Federer Wimbledon final.
