- \[2:00\]: Looked into inverse maintenance paper. Need to understand $\sigma$ stability condition, so need to read up on leverage scores. Seems like I could have done all this much quicker.
- \[1:20\]: Finished typing notes on Banks et al. Next step is to formalize questions and future directions.
- \[0:15\]: Process, see below.
- \[2:00\]: Formalized two thoughts. Need to read Bandeira et al. 2019 paper and finish typing up all open problems.

Since last meeting, put in large number of hours, but don't have much to show. Moving forward, should only learn new material when confident of its direct relevance; remaining time is best spent directly on research. The right approach seems to be as follows:

1. Quickly formalize concrete technical questions.
2. Try to attack those questions with existing tools.
    - If successful, return to first step.
    - If not, understand why. Then, go learn new tools or build new ones. Return to second step.

I seem to be spending too much time on the second part of step 2 and not enough on step 1 or the first part of step 2.

- \[2:10\]: Revisited the dynamic eigenvector approach. Concluded that we need to exploit special properties of update matrix $D$. Next step is see if Lee-Sidford inverse maintenance paper has any relevant ideas.
- \[3:15\]: Planned out next steps and typed up handwritten notes on Banks et al. paper. Need to finish typing up sketch of calculations for two examples and formalize questions and intuitions. Once that is done, can finally begin to move forward.
- \[0:10\]: Looked at notes on canonical SDP relaxation for CSPs from Gupta-O'Donnell lecture notes since the approach might be useful. See also Chapter in O'Donnell book for more background.

- \[1:30\]: Skimmed \[Lee-Padmanabhan 2019\] and \[Arora-Kale 2007\] to see if solvers can be implemented without explicitly computing $A^T A$. Realized that probably won't work for our application because they use JL. Next step is to look into inverse maintenance approach.
- \[0:30\]: Read advisor's email and skimmed tensor network stuff.
- \[0:30\]: Setup logging system.

Main accomplishment was watching Djokovic-Federer Wimbledon final.
