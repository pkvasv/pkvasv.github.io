# Prayaag Venkat

I am a second-year graduate student in the [theory of computation group](https://toc.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, advised by [Boaz Barak](https://www.boazbarak.org/). I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Maryland, College Park.

My graduate studies are supported by an [NSF Graduate Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).
