# Prayaag Venkat

I am a third-year graduate student in the [theory of computation group](https://toc.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, advised by [Boaz Barak](https://www.boazbarak.org/). I am currently visiting [Prasad Raghavendra](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~prasad/) at UC Berkeley and participating in the [HD20 Simons Institute program](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/hd20).

I am interested in the connections between: the Sum-of-Squares SDP hierarchy, statistical physics, average-case complexity theory, and information-computation gaps in high-dimensional statistics problems.


My graduate studies are supported by an [NSF Graduate Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).
